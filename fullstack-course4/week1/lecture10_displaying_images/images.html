        <h1>is life worth living?</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="dec_1980.jpg" width="400" heigh="235" alt="Picture with a quote">&quot;No. I’m 76. I’ve backpacked through more than 100 countries since 1957, many with my two sons. Started four successful
            companies. Retired at 45 and again at 49 after stumbling into another successful company. I’m married to an Asian woman
            27 years younger than me who was a model in Japan for six years. I can buy what I want, when I want. And, no, it isn’t
            worth it. Mainly because there really isn’t any point to any of it. I’m sitting in front of my computer at 10:48 pm
            wasting time typing this reply to you. Why? Is this reply “worth it”? Hell no. Your life at any point in time is the
            result of memories that don’t exist. There is nothing but “now”. Is “now” worth it? I guess the answer is subjective.&quot;
