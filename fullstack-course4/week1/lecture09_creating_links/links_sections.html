            <p>No. I don’t think it is. Our bodies are programmed to keep living, and also, most of us are conscious
               of the most mundane and inconsequential of actions we commit, that others commit. Put the two together
               (havig to live and being conscious of living) and shake it, and what you have is a cocktail called
               Absolute Drudgery. We are starting to survive to older ages every century. We’ve found ways to automate
               jobs and tasks that could have kept us too busy to even ask the question you are asking now. More and
               more things about Life are not necessary: marriage, gainful employment, high status… none of these 
               things are necessary for comfortable survival. And yet, I don’t see why we can’t try to enjoy Life.
               Whether you want to believe that there is a reason why you must lead a fulfilling life or not, it just
               feels better to try. And if you feel like you’ve done everything you could to live a good life and you
               have everything you want, make a new game and chase after something new that excites you. My house mate
               recently just brought his pet dog Annie who had been living with his mom for the better part of ten years.
               When I first met her in 2008, she was a spry, excited darling with a jet black coat. Now her face is mostly
               comprised of white (gray) fur and she doesn’t move as much. Does she still get excited to go outside? Hell
               yeah she does! Does she like eating a delicious bite of my New York steak? Hell yeah she does! We’re not much
               different from her when we have found what makes us happy. Her game is simple and it’ll probably suffice for
               the rest of her life until she passes on. In the games humans make, we find ways to be miserable whether we’re
               rich or poor, single or taken, well traveled or home bodies—why? It’s because we allow ourselves to play a
               game that includes misery and drudgery. There is nothing wrong with feeling like Life is arbitrary and pointless.
               Every task is. Whether you’re a plant or dog or human you are tasked with living. You’re plopped onto this planet,
               not by your own volition, and forced to live until the end of your life. If you were in a room full of things to do,
               you could of course, do nothing. But most of the time you’ll try to do something—especially if you don’t know how
               long you’ll be stuck in that room. If you do enough things, time passes quicker and then the door opens and you’re
               not waiting in the room anymore. Life is that room. Is it worth it? I don’t know if it matters all that much.
               It matters more that you’ve passed time in a way that suits you incredibly.</p>

            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <p>No. I’m 76. I’ve backpacked through more than 100 countries since 1957, many with my two sons. Started four successful
                companies. Retired at 45 and again at 49 after stumbling into another successful company. I’m married to an Asian woman
                27 years younger than me who was a model in Japan for six years. I can buy what I want, when I want. And, no, it isn’t
                worth it. Mainly because there really isn’t any point to any of it. I’m sitting in front of my computer at 10:48 pm
                wasting time typing this reply to you. Why? Is this reply “worth it”? Hell no. Your life at any point in time is the
                result of memories that don’t exist. There is nothing but “now”. Is “now” worth it? I guess the answer is subjective.</p>

            <h2>Section 3 - Is it worth living if one is unhappy?</h2>
            <p>I’m still wondering this same thing… I’m so unhappy that it’s painful just to live. I cry a lot these days, have gone
                through depression many times. Every time I step out of my house, I seem to piss someone off by just walking by,
                labeled weird and all those mean words. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even make eye contact with people or
                oncoming traffic. I hate myself. I hate my life. It won’t get better, only harder.
                And the only reason I’m still alive is because of my dog. Someone has to take care of him, love him, play with him.
                But once he’s gone, then what? Get a new dog? Or end it? It would be so much easier if someone could kill me instead.
                I’m too afraid to do it myself.</p>
