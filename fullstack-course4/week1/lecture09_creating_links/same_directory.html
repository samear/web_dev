    <h1>Is life really worth it?</h1>
    <body>
        <p>No. I don’t think it is. Our bodies are programmed to keep living, and also,
            most of us are conscious of the most mundane and inconsequential of actions we commit,
            that others commit. Put the two together (having to live and being conscious of living)
            and shake it, and what you have is a cocktail called Absolute Drudgery. We are starting
            to survive to older ages every century. We’ve found ways to automate jobs and tasks that
            could have kept us too busy to even ask the question you are asking now. More and more
            things about Life are not necessary: marriage, gainful employment, high status… none of
            these things are necessary for comfortable survival. And yet, I don’t see why we can’t
            try to enjoy Life. Whether you want to believe that there is a reason why you must lead
            a fulfilling life or not, it just feels better to try. And if you feel like you’ve done
            everything you could to live a good life and you have everything you want, make a new game
            and chase after something new that excites you. My house mate recently just brought his pet
            dog Annie who had been living with his mom for the better part of ten years. When I first met
            her in 2008, she was a spry, excited darling with a jet black coat. Now her face is mostly
            comprised of white (gray) fur and she doesn’t move as much. Does she still get excited to go
            outside? Hell yeah she does! Does she like eating a delicious bite of my New York steak? Hell
            yeah she does! We’re not much different from her when we have found what makes us happy.
            Her game is simple and it’ll probably suffice for the rest of her life until she passes on.
            In the games humans make, we find ways to be miserable whether we’re rich or poor, single or
            taken, well traveled or home bodies—why? It’s because we allow ourselves to play a game that
            includes misery and drudgery. There is nothing wrong with feeling like Life is arbitrary and pointless.
            Every task is. Whether you’re a plant or dog or human you are tasked with living. You’re plopped
            onto this planet, not by your own volition, and forced to live until the end of your life.
            If you were in a room full of things to do, you could of course, do nothing. But most of
            the time you’ll try to do something—especially if you don’t know how long you’ll be stuck in that room.
            If you do enough things, time passes quicker and then the door opens and you’re not waiting in the room
            anymore. Life is that room. Is it worth it? I don’t know if it matters all that much. It matters more
            that you’ve passed time in a way that suits you incredibly.
