            "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how
            the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have
            done them better.  The credit belongs to the man who is actually
            in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
            who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,
            because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who
            does actually strive to do the deeds; who spends himself in a worthy
            cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
            achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails
            while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
            cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat."
