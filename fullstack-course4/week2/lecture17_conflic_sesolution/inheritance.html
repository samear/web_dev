        <p>Inheritence allows us to write more global styles on parent elements and then "fine-tune"
            the styles for some of the child elements as needed.
            Such approach makes writing CSS very efficient.

        <p>The cascade is an algorithm that defines how user agents combine property
            values originating from different sources.
