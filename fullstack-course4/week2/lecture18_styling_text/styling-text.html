        <p>Here are some possible answers to the question of what makes life worth living:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>nothing</li>
            <li>religion</li>
            <li>happiness</li>
            <li>love, work, and play</li>
        </ol>
        <p>1. Nothing</p>
        <p class="style">A few despondent philosophers—such as Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and David Benatar—have cast
            doubts on whether life has any intrinsic meaning, and some people are driven to suicide by
            depression or negative events in their lives. But most people, fortunately, are able to find
            lots of reason to value their lives, and in surveys most people report themselves as pretty happy.
            So nihilism may not be a plausible position.
