        <h1>Anatoy ob a CSS Rule</h1>
        <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
        <p>CSS works by associating rules in HTML elements.  These rules govern how the content of specified elements
            should be displayed.  A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
        </p>
        <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
        <p>CSS is, essentially, a language for defining and selectively applying a collection of formatting rules to
            a webpage. In CSS, a rule is a property followed by list of values for that property, and rules always
            follow a simple syntax. A property simply specifies which feature is being defined. There are many
            properties (more than can be covered in this book) which define visual features such as the font, color,
            size, positioning, shadow effects, 3d translations, etc. of elements on the webpage. The second part of
            the rule is a list of values, with each value separated by a space. Each value might be any type of
            information (color, size, rotation, etc.) and must be listed in a specific order (the exact values
            required and their order depends on the property being set).</p>
