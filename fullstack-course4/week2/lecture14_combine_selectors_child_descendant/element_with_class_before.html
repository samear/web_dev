        <h1 class="highlight">Element with Class Selectors</h1>
        <p>In CSS, selectors are defined in the CSS Selectors specification; like any other part of CSS they need to
            have support in browsers for them to work. The majority of selectors that you will come across are defined
            in the Level 3 Selectors specification and Level 4 Selectors specification, which are both mature
            specifications, therefore you will find excellent browser support for these selectors.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">This is P with CLASS="highlight"</p>
        <div class="mainpoint highlight">This is the main point of the entire article.</div>
